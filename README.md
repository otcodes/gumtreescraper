# gumtreescraper
Hi, my name is Tobi Orisakiya. This is my very first project on github.
This is a scraper i built to collect phone numbers from gumtree results, do feel free to make use of the code and make changes are need.
The scraper collects in total 300 links, which you can increase or reduce depending on your needs. You will find the page iteration that does this. Each page contains 30 links in total, so the scraper, scrapes only ten pages you can increase it from 9 to any number of page minus one. That is for eleven pages it you change it to 11-1 which is 10. for 20 pages that is 20-1 which is 19.

thank you 
best regards 
OT
